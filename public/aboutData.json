"description":"People work with personal trainers for many reasons. Whether you want to develop an individualized program to support weight loss goals, get in shape, or simply feel that you'd benefit from the additional accountability or instruction, a personal trainer can be a great resource.But sometimes people are cautious about investing in a trainer. Cost can be an issue, and some people might feel intimidated by working with a pro. But certified fitness professionals are trained to work with clients of all backgrounds and fitness levels. And many can work out package deals to make the service more affordable."
